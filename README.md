This project is amied at building a reliable CY prediction model for Napoletan Pizza and Roman Pizza. The project is divided in two phases. 

The first phase entails the scraping of https://laconfraternitadellapizza.net/calcolapizza/ and the building of a prediction model from such data. 

The second phase builds on the Calcola Pizza model and integrate the data from Pizza Making predictive model. https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=22649.0

# Task 

1. Try first implementation with limited range 
2. Calculate time (Might considere to use pbrelicate)
3. Set up server 
4. Run and get the model
